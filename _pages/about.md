I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, within the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/). I work with Professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). My main research interests lie in Deep Bayesian Learning, in mutually enriching the Bayesian and deep learning methods. My recent researches focus on exploring deep generative models and representation learning methods, with applications to image generation, domain adaptation, etc. 

I received my Bachelor and Master's Degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of Prof. [Ya Zhang](https://ir.sjtu.edu.cn:18080/~yazhang/). I worked as a research assistant in [Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center(CMIC)](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx)
My research interests include Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference Model with application to Computer Vision, Multimedia Information Understanding using probabilistic modeling. I specifically researched deep generative models, especially on Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) and relevant applications. I was also in a sino-french education program, cooperating with the French “Grande Ecole” system; I have stayed in France at [Telecom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng). During my study in France, I worked with Prof. [Talel Abdessalem](https://bdmi.wp.imt.fr/holder/) in [Network and Computer Science Department (INFRES)](https://www.infres.telecom-paristech.fr/wp/) in Deep Bayesian Learning with application to deep matrix factorization.
