I am a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/), led by [Samy Bengio](https://bengio.abracadoudou.com). My main research interests lie in mutually enriching the Bayesian probabilistic methods and deep learning. My recent researches focus on exploring deep generative models and representation learning methods, making them efficient and robust in image generation, self-supervised learning, etc. 


**Previous Education**: 
I received my PhD degree from the University of Texas at Austin, within the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), where I worked with Professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). I had the honor to work as a research intern at AML team, Bytedance Inc, working with [Jianbo Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B1EhbCsAAAAJ&hl=en), [Quanzeng You](https://qzyou.github.io/index.html), [Guanghan Ning](http://guanghan.info/) and [Hongxia Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iJlC5mMAAAAJ&hl=en), and at Microsoft Research, where I work with [Pengcheng He](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/penhe/), [Weizhu Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wzchen/) and [Chunyuan Li](https://chunyuan.li/).

Previously, I received my Bachelor and Master's Degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of Prof. [Ya Zhang](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/yazhang/). I worked as a research assistant in [Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center(CMIC)](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx), where I had good fortune to work with [Jiangchao Yao](https://sunarker.github.io/), Xu Chen and [Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang).
At that time, my research mainly focused on deep generative models, especially on Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) and relevant applications. I was also a research intern at JHU, working with [Lingxi Xie](http://lingxixie.com/Home.html), [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) on exploring the effects of generative models on computer vision problems. 

I was also in a sino-french education program, cooperating with the French “Grande Ecole” system; I have stayed in France at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) and [Telecom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng). During my study in France, I worked with Prof. [Talel Abdessalem](https://bdmi.wp.imt.fr/holder/) in [Network and Computer Science Department (INFRES)](https://www.infres.telecom-paristech.fr/wp/) in Deep Bayesian Learning with application to deep matrix factorization.
