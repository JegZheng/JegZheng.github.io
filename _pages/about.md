I am currently a first-year PhD student in statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, within the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/). I work with Professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). My main research interests are in Deep Bayesian Learning and Deep Generative model.


## News
2019-08-28:  I start to study in UT Austin

##Previous Experience

### In Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China
I graduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of Prof. [Ya Zhang](http://ir.sjtu.edu.cn:18080/~yazhang/).  I worked as a research assistant in [Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center(CMIC)](http://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx)
My research interests include Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference Model with application to Computer Vision, Multimedia
Information Understanding using probabilistic modeling. I specifically researched on Deep Bayesian Learning and Deep Generative model, especially on
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and its applications.


### In Telecom ParisTech, France
I was also in a sino-french education program, cooperating with French “Grande Ecole” system, I have stayed in France at [Telecom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng). During my study in France, I worked with Prof. [Talel Abdessalem](https://bdmi.wp.imt.fr/holder/) in [Network and Computer Science Department (INFRES)](https://www.infres.telecom-paristech.fr/wp/) in Deep Bayesian Learning with application to deep matrix factorization.
