excerpt: 'Images play important roles in providing comprehensive understanding of our physical world. When thinking of a tourist city, one can immediately imagine pictures of its famous attractions. With the boom of social images, we attempt to explore the possibility of describing geographical characteristics of different regions. We here propose a Geographical Latent Attribute Model (GLAM) to mine regional characteristics from social images, which is expected to provide a comprehensive view of the regions. The model assumes that a geographical region consists of different “attributes” (e.g., infrastructures, attractions, events and activities) and “attributes” are interpreted by different image “clusters”. Both “attributes” and image “clusters” are modeled as latent variables. The experimental analysis on a collection of 2.5M Flickr photos regarding Chinese provinces and cities has shown that the proposed model is promising in describing regional characteristics. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model for place recommendation.'

This paper is motivated by the two-stage combination of probabilistic graphic model and deep learning. We found the DL-based extracted features are conducive for Bayesian learning in probabilistic graphic models. We further develop a tourist recommendation as its application in this field.

A topic model is designed for general representation to describe the characteristics of one given region. Given the collection of photos from different regions, we apply the features extracted from GoogLeNet in representation learning. Comparing the learned representation, the topic model produces a more powerful representation of the regional characteristics.

Geographical Latent Attribute Model (GLAM) suppose that a given geographical region consists of different “attributes” (e.g., infrastructures, attractions, events and activities) and “attributes” are interpreted by different image “clusters”.

When given a photo or a collection of photos, computing the characteristic representation of this collection and the similarity between characteristic representation can achieve the tourist recommendation and the location retrieval.
