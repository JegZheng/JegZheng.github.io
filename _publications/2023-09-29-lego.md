title: "Learning Stackable and Skippable LEGO Bricks for Efficient, Reconfigurable, and Variable-Resolution Diffusion Modeling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-10-10-lego
excerpt: "Diffusion models excel at generating photo-realistic images but come with significant computational costs in both training and sampling. While various techniques address these computational challenges, a less-explored issue is designing an efficient and adaptable network backbone for iterative refinement. Current options like U-Net and Vision Transformer often rely on resource-intensive deep networks and lack the flexibility needed for generating images at variable resolutions or with a smaller network than used in training. This study introduces LEGO bricks, which seamlessly integrate Local-feature Enrichment and Global-content Orchestration. These bricks can be stacked to create a test-time reconfigurable diffusion backbone, allowing selective skipping of bricks to reduce sampling costs and generate higher-resolution images than the training data. LEGO bricks enrich local regions with an MLP and transform them using a Transformer block while maintaining a consistent full-resolution image across all bricks. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGO bricks enhance training efficiency, expedite convergence, and facilitate variable-resolution image generation while maintaining strong generative performance. Moreover, LEGO significantly reduces sampling time compared to other methods, establishing it as a valuable enhancement for diffusion models."
