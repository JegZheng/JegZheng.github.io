excerpt: "Employing a forward Markov diffusion chain to gradually map the data to a noise distribution, diffusion probabilistic models learn how to generate the data by inferring a reverse Markov diffusion chain to invert the forward diffusion process. To achieve competitive data generation performance, they demand a long diffusion chain that makes them computationally intensive in not only training but also generation. To significantly improve the computation efficiency, we propose to truncate the forward diffusion chain by abolishing the requirement of diffusing the data to random noise. Consequently, we start the inverse diffusion chain from an implicit generative distribution, rather than random noise, and learn its parameters by matching it to the distribution of the data corrupted by the truncated forward diffusion chain. Experimental results show our truncated diffusion probabilistic models provide consistent improvements over the non-truncated ones in terms of the generation performance and the number of required inverse diffusion steps."

Employing a forward Markov diffusion chain to gradually map the data to a noise distribution, diffusion probabilistic models learn how to generate the data by inferring a reverse Markov diffusion chain to invert the forward diffusion process. To achieve competitive data generation performance, they demand a long diffusion chain that makes them computationally intensive in not only training but also generation. To significantly improve the computation efficiency, we propose to truncate the forward diffusion chain by abolishing the requirement of diffusing the data to random noise. Consequently, we start the inverse diffusion chain from an implicit generative distribution, rather than random noise, and learn its parameters by matching it to the distribution of the data corrupted by the truncated forward diffusion chain. Experimental results show our truncated diffusion probabilistic models provide consistent improvements over the non-truncated ones in terms of the generation performance and the number of required inverse diffusion steps.
